<h1>Project Based Internship in Kalbe Nutritionals x Rakamin Academy</h1>

<p>This repository showcases my internship project conducted in collaboration between Kalbe Nutritionals and Rakamin Academy. The project involved various stages of data analysis and visualization.</p>

<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using DBeaver:</strong> Conducted an initial examination of the data to understand its structure and patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Dashboard Creation using Tableau:</strong> Visualized key insights from the data. Check out the dashboard <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dindagaluh/viz/KalbeSalesPerformanceDashboard/Dashboard1">here</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> Utilized ARIMA for predicting future sales.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Employed the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment the customer base.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Results:</h2>
<p>
The formed ARIMA model is ARIMA(1,1,0)(2,1,0)[52], which indicates a weekly seasonality for daily data. The model achieved an RMSE of 17,1398. 
<br>
Through K-Means clustering, three optimal clusters were identified: High Value, Mid Value, and Casual Buyers.
