<h1>Project Based Internship - Kalbe Nutritionals x Rakamin Academy</h1>

<p>This repository showcases my internship project conducted in collaboration between Kalbe Nutritionals and Rakamin Academy. The project involved various stages of data analysis and visualization.</p>

<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using DBeaver:</strong> Conducted an initial examination of the data to understand its structure and patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Dashboard Creation using Tableau:</strong> Visualized key insights from the data. Check out the dashboard <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dindagaluh/viz/KalbeSalesPerformanceDashboard/Dashboard1">here</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Series Analysis using Python:</strong> Utilized ARIMA for predicting future sales.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Segmentation using Python:</strong> Employed the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment the customer base.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Results:</h2>
<p>
In the ARIMA modeling, seasonal effects tried include 7, 12, and 52. The best ARIMA model was ARIMA(1,1,0)(2,1,0)[52] with an RMSE of 17,1398. 
<br>
Clustering was performed using both K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means methods. Based on criteria such as silhouette, CH index, and David Bouldin index, the optimal number of clusters for each was found to be 3. The best method was determined using the ICD rate, and Fuzzy C-Means was identified as the superior method.
